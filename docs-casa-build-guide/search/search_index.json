Each half is joined together by a backbone of 2040 extrusion making the enclosure easy to dissemble for moving. The panels, sliding door, electronics, and basement will attach to this main frame. Throughout this stage remember to check for squareness and adjust accordingly.</p> <p>The outer frame assembly uses 8 different extrusions labeled A - H. Some extrusions are the same length but features different cross drill patterns so make sure to pay attention and select the correct extrusion. Cross drills are found on extrusions A, C, D, and H only. If you are cross drilling your own extrusion you may find the cross drill guides useful.</p> <p>Blind Joints</p> <p></p> <p>The frame of Casa is assembled using blind joints. These are simple and cheap joints that provide excellent strength through metal-to-metal contact. Blind joints require cross drilling the extrusion to allow access to tighten down a button head bolt and also require manual alignment. Make sure that joints are aligned and square when tightening.</p> <p>All blind joints are secured using an M5 x 10 BHCS screw. In the interest of simplifying this manual, we have chosen to omit the button head bolts.

To tune the preload make sure the lead-screws are greased appropriately, then install the 2 brass TR8x8 lead-screw nuts within the anti backlash block.</p> <p>Tighten the screws on one of the nuts so that it does not move, while leaving the other nut loose.</p> <p>Install the greased lead-screw temporarily into the block and begin to tighten the loose nut, taking care to apply the same number of turns to each of the screws.</p> <p>The ideal preload will allow for the lead-screw to still spin by hand but should have a moderate amount of resistance to it.

Click on the \"Console\" tab on the left hand side, and type the following into the <code>Send code...</code> box, then press ENTER:</p> <pre><code>M587 S\"your WiFi SSID\" P\"your WiFi password\"\n</code></pre> <p>You should see a green highlighted line indicating that the command was successful:</p> <p></p> <p>You now need to tell RRF to connect as a WiFi client rather than starting its own Access Point.</p> <p>We package a <code>network.g.example</code> file which configures RRF as a WiFi client, and can be used to set any user-specific settings that should not be overwritten when updating. The file needs to be renamed to <code>network.g</code> for it to load.</p> <p>To rename it, browse to the \"Files -&gt; System\" tab, right click on <code>network.g.example</code>, then click \"Rename\", and enter <code>network.g</code>:</p> <p></p> <p>You may need to further configure any network-specific settings in this file, but this is outside the scope of this guide - please refer to the Duet3D Gcode Documentation for this - specifically codes <code>M553</code>, <code>M554</code> and <code>M586</code>.</p> <p>After editing the file to your liking, you can restart the mainboard. Once restarted, it should attempt to connect to your WiFi network.</p> <p>You may have to use your router interface to identify the address that the Milo has been given on your network ifd this was not configured statically - this is outside of the scope of this guide.</p> <p>You can also connect to the mainboard over USB using Putty or another terminal emulator depending on your operating system - watching the output of the terminal when the machine connects to the WiFi network will show the IP address that has been assigned.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>When installing a new release of the RRF configuration as an upgrade, your <code>network.g</code> file will not be overwritten. However - the WiFi module will be updated, which may wipe all network details from the module itself.</p> <p>To avoid this making the machine unrecoverable (at least without connecting to USB), RRF will always reboot in Access Point mode after any update cycle. You can then re-enter the network details if necessary, using the <code>M587</code> command in Configure your WiFi network before rebooting.</p> <p>Additionally, if you are prompted by DWC to Install the updates, you can safely click No - these will be installed when you reboot and clicking Yes will just make the process take longer.</p> <p>At this point, the basic firmware setup is complete and all that remains are some firmware checks which will be covered later on in the manual.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>We only provide bundled firmware configurations for specific machine setups. If your machine is self-built, you will have to modify one of these configurations to match the mainboard, wiring and setup of your machine. Alternatively, you can use the TeamGloomy Configurator - but remember that this is aimed at 3D printer configurations so will need a number of changes to work effectively on Milo.</p> <p>It is now safe to perform the physical install of your board into your mainboard mount.</p> <p>Next Chapter: Assemble Electronics</p>"},{"location":"milo/printing/print_guide/","title":"Printing Guide","text":""},{"location":"milo/printing/print_guide/#file-naming","title":"File Naming","text":"<p>With your STL files downloaded and your printer warmed up, you may be wondering which parts to print in your favorite colors?
