Each half is joined by a backbone of 2040 extrusion, making the enclosure easy to disassemble for moving. The panels, sliding door, electronics, and basement will attach to this main frame. Throughout this stage, remember to check for squareness and adjust accordingly.</p> <p>The outer frame assembly uses eight different extrusions labeled A - H. Some extrusions are the same length but feature different cross-drill patterns, so ensure you select the correct extrusion. Extrusions A, C, D, and H are the extrusions that have cross-drilling. If you are self-sourcing, you may find the printable cross-drill guides handy.</p> <p>Electronics Bay and Door Placement</p> <p>To position the electronics bay on the opposite side, Casa can also be constructed to mirror the layout illustrated in these instructions. However, the doors must be installed on the side furthest from your electronics bay. This installation prevents the doors from impeding your ability to hit the e-stop. </p> <p>Blind Joints</p> <p></p> <p>Casa's frame is assembled using blind joints. These are simple and cheap joints that provide excellent strength through metal-to-metal contact. Blind joints require cross-drilling the extrusion to allow access to tighten down a button head bolt and also require manual alignment. Make sure that joints are aligned and square when tightening.</p> <p>All blind joints are secured using an M5 x 10 BHCS bolts. In the interest of simplifying this manual, we have chosen to omit the button head bolts from the images.

That said, you can re-run the Touch Probe configuration via the Configuration Wizard if you would like to re-calculate the values after making changes to your machine.</p> <p>Manual Measurements</p> <p>Even if you have a Touch Probe and a Toolsetter, the Wizard will ask you to take a few manual measurements using a Datum tool. This is necessary to enable tool offset compensation when using the Toolsetter and the Touch Probe together.</p> <p>In short - we cannot probe the length of the Touch Probe with the Toolsetter (or the other way round, for that matter) because the Touch Probe and Toolsetter require different activation pressures - one will activate before the other, and this will never be accurate enough to measure different tool lengths and offsets.</p> <p>The manual measurement calculates the distance between a surface we can probe (using the Touch Probe at the start of every job) and the activation point of the Toolsetter, using a tool whose length does not change between the measurements.</p> <p>This gives us a relative distance that can be used to calculate the expected activation point of the Toolsetter when changing tools, the tool offset is the difference between the expected activation point and the actual point the Toolsetter was activated at.</p> <p>If you'd like to understand more of how this works, the macro files themselves are quite well commented and easy to read - look at <code>G8000</code>, <code>G37</code>, <code>tpre.g</code> and <code>tpost.g</code>.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>If you receive any syntax or other errors during the configuration process, please report these on the MillenniumOS repository as an issue or ask for assistance on our Discord.</p>"},{"location":"millennium-os/manual/chapters/20_installation/#user-variables","title":"User Variables","text":"<p>When the configuration wizard completes, it writes the settings to the <code>mos-user-vars.g</code> file.

The X and Y axes cannot move through the XY Gantry plate so the work area is limited by the dimensions of the gantry plate as well as the length and width of the table.</p> <p>It is important to note that the Y-Axis cannot be made any longer than it already is, because the size limitation on the Y-Axis is dictated by how far the spindle sits out towards the operator from the main column.</p> <p>Extending the spindle outwards from the column any further than it already is would apply too much leverage against the column.</p>"},{"location":"milo/faq/#what-materials-can-the-machine-be-used-on","title":"What materials can the machine be used on?","text":"<p>This depends on the strength of your critical parts and the tooling you have, but the stock machine is capable of cutting wood and aluminium effectively, and should also be capable of operations in mild steel (with caveats!)</p>"},{"location":"milo/faq/#what-sort-of-repeatable-tolerances-can-i-expect","title":"What sort of repeatable tolerances can I expect?","text":"<p>This depends on a large number of factors. Every step in the build process has an impact on how accurate your machine is, and the more meticulous you are about making sure rails, axes and lead-screws are aligned, anti-backlash nuts are properly preloaded and bearing stacks are suitably locked, the more accurate you can expect your machine to be.</p> <p>Likewise, if you choose to use 3D printed XY and Z gantry plates instead of the suggested metal ones, then you will also see a negative impact on accuracy and repeatability.</p> <p>You must also remember that Milo is not a professional grade machine, and you should temper your expectations accordingly. For a machine that can be built for the cost of an expensive 3D printer, Milo is incredibly capable, but because of the design choices made to make it available at this cost, it will take a bit of effort to keep it at the levels of reliability and repeatability that it is capable of.</p> <p>If you're looking for numbers - a Milo built following the assembly instructions with no further tweaking will be able to hold tolerances of +-0.1mm with 3D printed XY and Z gantry plates, and approaching +-0.03mm or lower with metal gantry plates and FMJ.</p>"},{"location":"milo/faq/#what-is-the-full-metal-jacket","title":"What is the Full Metal Jacket?","text":"<p>The FMJ is a modification for the Milo V1.5 that replaces the 3D printed Z-Axis joining plates with steel or aluminium jackets on either side. This improves the weight, rigidity and accuracy of the main column significantly, allowing it to be extended up to a maximum of 120mm of clearance over the table.</p> <p>The FMJ is not part of the standard design as it cannot itself be machined on Milo V1.5 due to its' size.</p> <p>The size of the FMJ is user-defined - if machining height is not of importance to you, you can use an FMJ with the original 60mm clearance. If you want your machine to have more clearance, then you will need to extend the length of the 2 x 4080x260mm C-Beam extrusions which make up the main column.
