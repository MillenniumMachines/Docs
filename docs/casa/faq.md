## Can I use plywood / acrylic panels?
Yes! You can use whatever panel material you like but make sure to consider the impact that changing the material may have on the enclosure. Wooden panels may rot with exposure to coolant, acrylic may shatter on impact, and different materials will have different sound damping properties. 

## Are the panels impact resistant / is Casa a substitute for safety glasses?
No. Casas panels are designed to contain light coolants, chips, and sound. Casa is not designed to protect you from flying tools, workpieces, etc.

You should still take safety precautions while using Casa in an enclosure.
