!!! note
    The electronics bay provides space to contain your machine's electronics. Due to the unique nature of each machine setup and electronics choices, this manual will not attempt to guide you through the fitting or wiring of your electronics. This manual will focus on installing the front and rear I/O panels, cable entries, cable guides, and DIN rail mounts.
