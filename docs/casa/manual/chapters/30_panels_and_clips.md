# Panels and Clips

Begin by fitting the static panels to the frame. The panels fit over the extrusion and are fixed in place using printed clips. Each panel should have weather stripping applied to all inner edges.

!!! note
    Each clip is referred to by a letter. The clip's letter is in the STL file name and printed into the part. Make sure to select the correct clip, as many look similar. Always check the letter on the part. Secure with M3 x 10 SHCS bolts.

Attach the door to the enclosure. To do this, you [pivot](https://imgur.com/pivot-Zei0mk9) the door, on the edge that has the doornuts, into the extrusion track of the door frame. Then, put the door assembly in its "closed" position before attaching the hinges to the frame. Secure the hinge with M5 x 8 FHCS bolts.
