# Introduction

Take a deep breath for a second and realize something.

You... yes **YOU**, are about to commit to wiring and programming a robot that can cut through metal, let alone your squishy human parts.
A machine that can easily electrocute you, cut you or set fire to your whole neighborhood if it's not given the respect it deserves.

**Please** give this machine the respect it deserves !!!

!!! warning

    Please follow the manual to the letter and perform any additional research you deem necessary before attempting to use Milo for the first time.

    If there is anything, and we mean _anything_ that you are curious or unsure about, you are more than welcome to ask us on our discord server.

    After all, you are special to us and we don't want you to get hurt.

Most importantly from everyone at the Millennium Machines team, have fun wiring your very first Milo!

## Parts List and Printing Guidelines

The Millennium Machines team has provided a printing list with settings for you as a guideline for printing the parts necessary for the build. This list can be found [here](../../printing/print_guide.md#electronics-table).

Remember, these settings are only a guideline, and are open to your own interpretations - but we do highly recommend following them to achieve the best mechanical properties for each individual part.


#### Primary Color

Example: `Handwheel Body x2.stl`
These files have no prefix in their filename so are safe to print in your primary color.

#### Accent Color

Example: `[a] Table Bolt Down Bracket A x2.stl`
These files are prefixed with `[a]` and are intended to be printed in your chosen accent color.

#### Quantity Required

Example: `Handwheel Body x2.stl`
If any file ends with `x#`, that is telling you the quantity of that part required to build the machine.

## Drilling Out Holes

To make some features printable without support, some features are printed with a sacrificial floor. These parts will need to be drilled and or cut out before use.

## T-Nuts Application

This machine requires an immense amount of T-nuts. In the interest of simplifying this manual, we have chosen to omit the installation of T-nuts. Wherever a part interfaces with an extrusion in a way that looks like it requires a T-nut, then it should be considered a part that requires a T-nut.
