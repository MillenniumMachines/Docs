## E-Stop Disassembly

To install your E-stop you must first disassemble it. Most E-stops split in two by spinning the button side
whilst keeping the body in place. To reassemble it, perform the aforementioned steps backwards.

![Disassemble e-stop](../img/assemble_electronics/assemble_electronics_step_6.png){: .shadow}

Install the E-Stop into the front of the electronics table skirt. If your E-Stop has a threaded locking collar, tighten this against the back of the skirt.

![Install E-stop](../img/assemble_electronics/assemble_electronics_step_7.png){: .shadow}

Snap (or bolt) the E-Stop switch plate and switch(es) onto the back of the E-Stop assembly.

## AC Wiring

!!! warning "Here Be Dragons"
    Hopefully it does not need to be said, but this is the part of the build process where you need to be most thorough. You should never take shortcuts, guess or "wing it" when it comes to AC wiring.

    Getting any of this wrong, or with connections back to front, will at minimum cost you real money - and at maximum, a lot of pain or **actual death**.

    Check, and re-check _everything_ with a multimeter. If you don't have, or don't know how to use a multimeter at this point, you owe it to yourself and everyone who loves you to go and buy one and learn how to use it before continuing.

!!! info annotate "Components Required"
    ```
    18AWG Mains Wiring (Neutral, Live, Ground)
    ```

If you plan to use a VFD to power your spindle, you can split the AC input going to the PSU to power your VFD as seen in the diagram below.

!!!note
    Consult local electrical regulations for information on cable termination, minimum cross-sectional-area, suitable fuse and breaker sizes, and refer to your VFD manual for their recommended installation method which may include input or output reactors or contactors.

Wire the AC Inlet, PSU, E-stop and VFD according to the diagram below.

![AC Wiring diagram](../img/assemble_electronics/assemble_electronics_step_9.png){: .shadow}

### VFD / Spindle Wiring

There are a large number of VFD and spindle options available. This section of the manual provides general guidence only. You should refer to your specific VFD manual for its setup. 

![VFD Wiring diagram](../img/assemble_electronics/assemble_electronics_step_9_5.jpg){: .shadow}

!!!warning "VFD and Spindle Ground"
    You **MUST** make sure that your VFD and Spindle are properly grounded. Your VFD and Spindle are the only mains-powered items that you will come into contact with regularly during the operation of the machine, so these **MUST** have an operational ground connection **AT ALL TIMES**, and you **MUST** make sure that the socket you plug Milo into is properly grounded as well.

    Using a multimeter in continuity testing mode, you **MUST** be able to detect a connection between the ground pin on your AC inlet socket, the ground connector on your VFD, and the casing of your spindle.

    If your VFD is grounded but your spindle is not, you will need to [open the top casing of the spindle and connect the ground pin to the case of the spindle](https://wiki.printnc.info/en/electronics/vfd/config#grounding-shielding) - there are a number of spindles available where this connection is not made in the factory.

    You should **ALWAYS** check this before operating the machine for the first time.

## Mainboard Mounting

!!! info annotate "Components Required"
    ```
    4 x M3x10mm Self-tapping Screw
    2 x M5x10mm BHCS
    1 x Fly-CDYv3
    1 x Mainboard Mount (1)
    ```
1. :material-printer-3d-nozzle-heat-outline: Print this part using the [recommended settings](../../printing/print_guide.md#electronics-table)!

Screw the mainboard onto the mount using M3x10mm self-tapping screws.

![Mainboard Mount with self-tappers](../img/assemble_electronics/assemble_electronics_step_10.png){: .shadow}

---

Mount the mainboard to the side extrusions of the electronics table using M5x10mm BHCS.

## DC Wiring

!!! info annotate "Components Required"
    ```
    20AWG Silicone / PTFE Wiring (24v DC)
    24AWG Silicone / PTFE Wiring (Control wiring 3.3-5v DC)
    ```

Depending on how you want to control your spindle, you may need to add a few extra PCBs.

The example below is for a VFD controlled spindle that accepts a 0-10V analog signal to control spindle speed.

You may also require a relay to send an enable signal to your VFD. If you wish to control your spindle manually then you can safely ignore these extra components.

![DC Wiring diagram](../img/assemble_electronics/assemble_electronics_step_12.png){: .shadow}

!!! note
    There is no standard for motor wire colors - the motor wires shown in this example do no correlate with the rest of the legend.

!!! warning
    For safety reasons it is always a good idea to wire your endstops in a normally closed configuration. This allows your machine to detect breaks in any of your cabling rather than you manually detecting a failed endstop circuit when the table tries to move off the end of an axis!

!!! info annotate "VFD Wiring"
    There are a large number of VFD and spindle options available. This wiring diagram provides general guidence only. You should refer to your specific VFD manual for its setup.

## Final Installation


!!! info annotate "Components Required"
    ```
    4 x M5x8mm BHCS
    1 x Electronics Enclosure Cover (1)
    ```
1. :material-laser-pointer: This cover can be laser cut from acrylic, or printed if you have a 3D printer large enough.


<!-- TODO: What fans are these? They aren't in the BOM -->
Screw the fans into the electronics enclosure cover using self-tapping fan screws.

![Fan installation](../img/assemble_electronics/assemble_electronics_step_13.png){: .shadow}

---

Install the cover onto the electronics enclosure using M5x8mm BHCS, plugging the fans into the mainboard before screwing the cover down.
