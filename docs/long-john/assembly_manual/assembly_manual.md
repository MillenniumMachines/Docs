# Assembly Manual
!!! info annotate "Loctite"
    These machines vibrate an immense amount when in use and fasteners are bound to back out. donâ€™t be afraid to add a little bit of loctite to your central screw to avoid this problem. Loctite should **not** be used on the self tapping screws as the chemicals in loctite may damage the ABS and cause it to weaken.
